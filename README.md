This is my attempt at an Oregon Trail clone. This will be made ffrom scratch the the knowledge I've learned about python. This will be a baseline as to things that I've picked up on and hopefully in the end I'll have a full, working game complete with many features. This is pretty much be parrallel with whatever I've learned as I go through my coding journey in python so check in regularly to see what I've been up to. Maybe in the future I can take this source code and maybe port it into an app or browser game but that would be long into the future. Stay tuned !
